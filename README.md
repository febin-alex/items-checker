# items-checker
A simplistic checklist app that lets you enter and modify items and their count and saves it for later review. 
It lets the user add items in a list with an adjustable counter next to it. The user can later increment or decrement the count of each item as they please. 
This list is saved and can later be retrieved for review.

This app's primary objective is to help people keep track of what they have packed.

For example, when I go home from my hostel, I take some of my clothes with me and I usually write down in a text editor what all clothes and how many of each(eg. Count of shirts, tshirts, socks)
So that when I go back to my hostel I only need to take a few clothes (according to how many I have there)

This process took some time as the clothes I add in the list aren't counter in order as it's all tucked inside a messy suitcase
For eg I would count it as "2black pants, 1tshirt, 2socks, 1black pants, 1socks etc)
So each time I enter a number into the text editor, I have to:

 0. Change all values of items I had written down previously to 0 
 *Look through each item*
 1. see if the item is already written down
 2. If it is then delete old number next to it and enter new count
 3. If it is not then enter current count of it and enter name
 4. This process is repeated till my whole suitcase has been checked

On this app however, we only need to :

Reset
0. Enter item name once
1. Increment value
2. Repeat
